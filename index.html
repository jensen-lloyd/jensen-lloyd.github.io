Hi! My name's Jensen, a year 11 student from Melbourne, Australia.

I love technology, music, playing guitar, history, psychology, biology and economics.

<h3>Currently expanding my technology skills by:</h3>
- Learning the Dart programming language, and Flutter framework<br>
- Studying for CCNA<br>
- Mucking around with my Linux server in my spare time :D<br><br>


<h3>Some of my projects so far:</h3><br>
    - <a href="https://github.com/jensen-lloyd/crappy_chat">Crappy Chat</a> - A terminal based chatroom over WebSockets, written both server and client side in Dart<br>

    - <a href="http://thetechclicks:80">Collab List</a> - A collaborative shopping list for households, written in PHP as a school project (VCE Software Development Unit 3/4)<br>
