Hi! My name's Jensen, a first year University student from Melbourne, Australia.

I am studying a Bachelor of Computer Science (Professional) at RMIT University.

I love technology, music, playing guitar, history, psychology, biology and economics.

Currently expanding my technology skills by:

    Learning the Dart programming language, and Flutter framework
    Studying for CCNA
    Mucking around with my Linux server in my spare time :D
    Learning Git
    Improving skills in PHP/HTML

Some of my projects so far:

    Crappy Chat A terminal based chatroom over WebSockets, written both server and client side in Dart

    Collab List A collaborative shopping list for households, written in PHP as a school project (VCE Software Development Unit 3/4)
