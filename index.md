Hi! My name's Jensen, a University student from Melbourne, Australia.

Currently studying Bachelor of Computer Science (Professional) at RMIT.

I love digital technology, music, playing guitar, history and economics.

Currently expanding my technology skills by:
- Learning the Dart programming language, and Flutter framework
- Studying for CCNA qualification, which I aim to complete by June 2024
- Continuing to learn and practice usage of Git for managing files in my projects
- Practicing administrating my two Linux servers (Cloud VPS and Local), running a variety of tools and applications such as VPN, backups over FTP, personal DNS, and hosting projects that I am working on


Some of my projects so far:

- [Collab List](https://github.com/jensen-lloyd/CollabList)
    A collaborative shopping list for households, written in PHP as a school project (VCE Software Development Unit 3/4)
