Hi! My name's Jensen, a year 11 student from Melbourne, Australia.

I love technology, music, playing guitar, history, psychology, biology and economics.

Currently expanding my technology skills by:
- Learning the Dart programming language, and Flutter framework
- Studying for CCNA
- Mucking around with my Linux server in my spare time :D


Some of my projects so far:
    - <a href="https://github.com/jensen-lloyd/crappy_chat">Crappy Chat</a> - A terminal based chatroom over WebSockets, written both server and client side in Dart

    - <a href="http://thetechclicks.com:80">Collab List</a> - A collaborative shopping list for households, written in PHP as a school project (VCE Software Development Unit 3/4)
